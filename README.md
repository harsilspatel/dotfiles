## Tips and tricks ‚ú®
Here are a few tricks that help me be productive!

### Redundant caps lock
In <kbd>caps lock</kbd>'s stead, holding down <kbd>shift</kbd> works for capitalizing letters. So a common hack is to map to it to <kbd>escape</kbd> and <kbd>control</kbd>.
- <kbd>caps lock</kbd> to <kbd>escape</kbd>
- <kbd>caps lock</kbd> + <kbd>\<key\></kbd> to <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>\<key\></kbd>

### Better shifting
Pressing just a <kbd>shift</kbd> (by itself) does nothing, it's useful only when pressed with other keys. So it can be mapped to parentheses which are used very frequently in programming.
- <kbd>left shift</kbd> to <kbd>(</kbd>
- <kbd>right shift</kbd> to <kbd>)</kbd>

Please note, this mapping is only for when a <kbd>shift</kbd> key pressed by itself. If pressed in combination with other key it works as it used.

### Convenient navigation
Arrow keys are very frequently used but they require moving the hand away from the home row. We can create vim-like mappings:
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> to <kbd>left</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> to <kbd>down</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> to <kbd>up</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> to <kbd>right</kbd>

Note that we're only mapping the <kbd>right command</kbd> and leaving the left one as is.

## Roadmap üó∫
### Hyper and Meh keys
Hyper and Meh, terms popularized by [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) community, mean combinations of modifiers. Having two sets of <kbd>command</kbd> and <kbd>option</kbd> keys seems redundant, especially when both are relatively accessible as compared <kbd>escape</kbd> and arrow keys, so one of the sets can be mapped to hyper and meh keys.
- <kbd>right option</kbd> to <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> (Meh key)
- <kbd>right command</kbd> to <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> (Hyper key)

### Window manager
My ideal workflow would include the ability control and manipulate windows only via keyboard. So need to invest some time configuring [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) to achieve that!
