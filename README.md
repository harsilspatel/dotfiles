## Tips and tricks ‚ú®
Here are a few tricks, some inspired from Steve Losh's [A modern space cadet](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/), that help me be productive.

### Redundant caps lock
Holding down <kbd>shift</kbd> does the job so a common hack that programmers employ to speed up their workflow is to map <kbd>caps lock</kbd> to <kbd>escape</kbd> and <kbd>control</kbd>.
- <kbd>caps lock</kbd> to <kbd>escape</kbd>
- <kbd>caps lock</kbd> + <kbd><key></kbd> to <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd><key></kbd>

### Better shifting
Pressing shift keys alone does nothing, they're useful only when pressed with other keys. So those can be mapped to parentheses which are very regularly used in programming.
- <kbd>left shift</kbd> to <kbd>(</kbd>
- <kbd>right shift</kbd> to <kbd>)</kbd>

### Convenient navigation
Arrow keys are some of the most frequently used keys which require moving hands away from the home row. We can get inspiration from [Bram Moolenaar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar) and create mappings like so:
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> to <kbd>left</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> to <kbd>down</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> to <kbd>up</kbd>
- <kbd>right command</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> to <kbd>right</kbd>

Note that we're only mapping the <kbd>right command</kbd> and leaving the left one as is.

## Roadmap üó∫
### Hyper and Meh keys
Having two <kbd>command</kbd> and <kbd>option</kbd> keys feels redundant, especially when both are accessible as compared <kbd>escape</kbd> and arrow keys. Those two modifiers will be far more useful if mapped as hyper and meh keys.
- <kbd>right option</kbd> to <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> (Meh key)
- <kbd>right command</kbd> to <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> (Hyper key)

### Window manager
An ideal workflow would include being able to control and manipulate windows only via keyboard. Need to spend some time configuring [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) to achieve that.
